# Indian-Agriculture-Data


The file begins with importing the required Python libraries and reading the dataset into Google Colab as an CSV file.
The next part involves performing data analytics and preprocessing.
After cleaning the data, a SQL connection is established from Google Colab to TiDB Cloud.
Once the connection is successful:
A new database named AgriData is created in TiDB Cloud.
A table named Indian_agricultural is created within this database.
The cleaned dataset is inserted into the Indian_agricultural table.
After inserting the data, visualization part takes place.
I created 15 visualizations to better understand the dataset and uncover meaningful insights.
Additionally, 15 SQL queries were written and executed to analyze various aspects of the Indian Agricultural data.
A connection to Power BI was successfully established, and the same 15 visualizations were recreated within Power BI to provide an interactive and dynamic analytics experience.
A PDF file has been included, showcasing all the Power BI visualizations and their insights.
